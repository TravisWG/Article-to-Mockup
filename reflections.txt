You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I had some previous html experience so this lesson acted more as a refresher for some tags that I don't use frequently like the horizontal rule, strikethrough, and superscript tags.  Hopefully, I didn't miss anything when I tried to match everything to the mockup.  *fingers crossed*
